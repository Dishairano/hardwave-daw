# Sign a Windows binary with Azure Trusted Signing.

# Tauri calls this once per file it bundles, with the file as the only
# argument, so the installer and everything inside it are signed before
# the updater signature is taken over them. Signing afterwards would
# change the bytes the updater had already signed, and every running
# copy would refuse the update.
#
# Without the Azure settings in the environment this does nothing and
# says so: a local build has no business needing the company's
# certificate, and a developer's build should not fail for the want of
# one. A release is different. On a release tag (v...) a missing setting
# or a signature that does not check out stops the build: nothing ships
# unsigned.
